## Fix Log

### 2025-07-03 - Network Access Issue Fix
**Problem**: Dev server only accessible via localhost:3000, not accessible from other devices on the same network for team collaboration.

**Solution**: Modified package.json:6 to add `-H 0.0.0.0` flag to the dev script.
- Changed: `"dev": "next dev --turbopack"`
- To: `"dev": "next dev --turbopack -H 0.0.0.0"`

**Result**: Server now binds to all network interfaces, allowing teammates to access via IP address (e.g., 192.168.1.100:3000).

**Files Modified**:
- `/package.json` - Updated dev script

### 2025-07-03 - WSL2 Network Access Issue
**Problem**: Server accessible via localhost but teammates cannot connect using 0.0.0.0:3000 from other devices on the network.

**Root Cause**: Running in WSL2 environment. WSL2 IP (172.28.45.232) is not accessible from external devices. External devices need to connect to the Windows host IP address.

**Solution**: 
1. Identified Windows host IP: 192.168.1.27 (from `ipconfig`)
2. Teammates must use: **192.168.1.27:3000** (not 0.0.0.0:3000)
3. ‚úÖ Windows firewall rule created successfully using PowerShell as Admin:
   `New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "WSL2 Port 3000" -Direction Inbound -Protocol TCP -LocalPort 3000 -Action Allow`
4. ‚ùå Initial test failed - connection timed out to Windows IP
5. üîß **Additional fix needed**: WSL2 port forwarding rule:
   `netsh interface portproxy add v4tov4 listenport=3000 listenaddress=0.0.0.0 connectport=3000 connectaddress=172.28.45.232`
6. ‚úÖ **Final result**: Network access working successfully

**Important Notes**:
- Firewall rule persists after restart
- Port forwarding rule needs to be re-run after each computer restart
- Alternative: Run `npm run dev` directly in Windows PowerShell to avoid WSL2 networking issues

**Files Modified**: None (configuration issue)

**Commands Used**:
- `netstat -tlnp | grep :3000` - Confirmed server listening on 0.0.0.0:3000
- `curl -I http://172.28.45.232:3000` - Confirmed server accessible via WSL2 IP
- `cmd.exe /c "ipconfig"` - Found Windows host IP address
